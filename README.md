# Gaussian GND

This repository superimposes atomistic data from MD simulation onto spatial tessellations, calculating mesh size dependent GND (geometrically necessary dislocation) signal. 

The project consists of three parts: 
1. analyzing output from OVITO and export txt files containing atomistic defect information 
2. generating spatial tessellation using open-source library
3. using cell-edge detection process to overlay defect information with spatial tessellation to generate GND signal

## Background



The goals for this repository are:

1. A well defined **specification**. This can be found in the [Spec document](spec.md). It is a constant work in progress; please open issues to discuss changes.
2. **An example README**. This Readme is fully standard-readme compliant, and there are more examples in the `example-readmes` folder.
3. A **linter** that can be used to look at errors in a given Readme. Please refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5).
4. A **generator** that can be used to quickly scaffold out new READMEs. See [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
5. A **compliant badge** for users. See [the badge](#badge).

## Install

This project uses [python](https://www.python.org/), [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/).  

```sh
$ npm install --global standard-readme-spec
```

## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
