This project superimposes atomistic data from MD simulation onto spatial tessellations, calculating mesh size dependent GND (geometrically necessary dislocation) signal. 

The project consists of three parts: 
1. analyzing output from OVITO and export txt files containing atomistic defect information 
2. generating spatial tessellation using open-source library
3. using cell-edge detection process to overlay defect information with spatial tessellation to generate GND signal
