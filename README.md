This project superimposes atomistic data from MD simulation onto spatial tessellations, 
thus calculating mesh size dependent GND (geometrically necessarry dislocation) signal. 

The project consists of three parts: 
1. analysing output from OVITO and export txt files containing atomistic defect information 
2. generating spatial tessellation using open source library
3. using cell-edge detection process to overlay defect information with spatial tessellation to generate GND signal
4.
